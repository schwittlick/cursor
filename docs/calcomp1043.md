    pen rondell has a bug
    when turning it on the pen rondell servo/stepper is jiggling and 
    the machine goes int error mode.
    when moving the x-axis manually slightly, the motor jiggles stronger and the diagnosis happens fast
    .
    it seems the stepper encoder might not work?
    cables and main board look very good.
    .
    the poti on the rondell motor platine doesnt change anything and might be resposible for the pen height/pressure.
    .
    there is no manual anywhere for this machine.
